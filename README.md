# PCBS_Associating_Colours

Note : in the following, a "colour" (a string refering to a colour bewteen inverted comas) refers to a word actually refering to a particular colour. On the other hand, a COLOUR refers to the colour of the font in which a word is written. For instance, BLUE "red" will refer to the word "red" written in blue.

The experiment is inspired by a well-known cognitive bias concerning fast recognition of colours. For instance, we know that a subject is slower consciously identifying a COLOUR when it is the font of another "colour" (e.g. when "red" is written in BLUE and that participants have to say "Blue") than when the COLOUR is identical to the "colour". 

The subject will face a black screen with 5 coloured buttons. The first phase will be one of learning : "colours" COLOURED in the colour they refer to will be displayed on the screen, and participants must click the right button the fastest they can. Their reaction time is not measured, as this is only meant to make participants learn the disposition of colour buttons on screen.

Second, a set of chosen words will appear on screen. A third of them are "colours", another third are words clearly related to colours ("snow", "dove"... for white for example) while the final third is neutral considering colour ("abstract", "dictionary"...). Each word will be coloured in a COLOUR to which they're not related. Reaction times are measured and stored in a file. 

The idea is to compare reaction times between neutral words, "colours, and words related to colours. One point is to show if it is really the fact that a "colour" is in another COLOUR than what it refers to that slows participants in consciously recognising them, or if it's only the fact that the participant's brain has two different messages at the time (a COLOUR and a word, regardless of its connexion to colour in general). A second point is to show whether a word that is not a "colour" but only related to one can slows a participant's reaction time as strongly as a "colour".
